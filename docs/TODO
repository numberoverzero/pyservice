TODO
========================

Project:
    1) Add handler tests for Client AND Server, as well as more end-to-end tests
        Adding handler during stack execution
        Handler ordering
        Catching exceptions
        Nested calls - handler during operaiton 'foo' invokes operation 'bar' on client

    2) Proper logging - check out how this is done with bottle/gevent
                        since the stuff that comes with a stock
                        gevent/bottle webserver is pretty nice.
    3) Testing refactor:
        A) Properly mock out bottle.request, even if it means
                taking another test dependency for the mocks
                package.  It's silly for service to have a _bottle
                property
    2) Add Serializer for JSON-RPC 2.0
