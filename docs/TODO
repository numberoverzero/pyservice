TODO
========================

Project:
    0) Create universal description for testing that can be used in each step,
        instead of re-defining it in every test.  Saves a lot of space in each test
        and makes the behavior being tested much clearer.
    1) Re-add layer architecture to both client + server
    2) Proper logging - check out how this is done with bottle/gevent
                        since the stuff that comes with a stock
                        gevent/bottle webserver is pretty nice.
    3) Testing refactor:
        A) Update/remove the client requests testing, since
                it's slow and shouldn't be necessary. It's
                more or less testing the requests library,
                not pyservice-specific code
        B) Properly mock out bottle.request, even if it means
                taking another test dependency for the mocks
                package.  It's silly for service to have a _bottle
                property
    2) Add Serializer for JSON-RPC 2.0
